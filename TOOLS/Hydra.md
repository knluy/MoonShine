What is Hydra?
Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program; a quick system login password 'hacking' tool.

We can use Hydra to run through a list and 'bruteforce' some authentication service. Imagine trying to manually guess someones password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.
