#### Operators

Symbol / Operator | Description
-|-
& | This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&& |This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
&gt; | This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
&gt;&gt; | This operator does the same function of the &gt; operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
