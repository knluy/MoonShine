#### basic pentesing 

export IP: 10.10.35.77

In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

- brute forcing 
- hash cracking 
- service enumeration
- Linux Enumeration


The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your OpenVPN configuration file.
